I came to tech from a background in surgical veterinary medicine. One of the areas that I was always frustrated with was the form used to record readings during an anesthetic procedure. This anesthesia app aims to calm the woes of the anesthetic technician by making this form easier to look at and interact with. A user is able to log in, add a patient, add a procedure for the patient, and take readings for that procedure. All information is stored in Firebase so that when a user logs in, they can find a patient as well as a history of patient procedures.  

###To run: ###
